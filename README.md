# Speakr

## What is this

This is a social media platform made by Warre Bossaert as a finalproject at secondary school Busleyden Atheneum Zandpoort for the subject projectmanagement.


## Concept

My idea for the website is that you can share memorable moments, and to communicate with others through sharing images and videos and/or chatting. That way those memories will live on forever and can others, who know you (or not) can see those as well. My idea was to make it with such interface so itâ€™s as user friendly as possible, to make it accessible for the most people. On the website you can perform multiple actions, such as:
-	Creating accounts through the register page.
-	Log in with a previously or newly made account.
-	See posts from your friends and those who you are following on the homepage.
-	View popular posts from all users of the platform on the explore page.
-	Like and comment on posts to boost those on the explore page.
-	Share posts outside of the platform.
-	Connect with friends by following them on their profile page.
-	Message those friends, or others that you are following.
-	Search for usernames of friends of yours.
-	Visit your own profile page to see the number of followers, posts and likes and edit your profile.
-	Creating a post through the menu when clicked on the profile icon.
-	Edit this post after completion of the creation.
-	Change your password and email address on the settings page.
-	Boost your posts to more users with advertisements.
